This includes common-sense inquiries, legal or logical questions, basic math, short coding tasks, multiple-choice questions, greetings, casual chat, daily planning, and inquiries about you or your team.\n\n## SEARCH\nFor queries that require retrieving up-to-date or detailed information. This includes time-sensitive or location-specific questions like current events or weather. Use this only if the information isn\'t readily available.\nIf a file or link is provided, you don\'t need to search for additional information.\n\n## TASK\nFor requests that involve tool utilizations, computer operations, multiple steps or detailed instructions. Examples include software development, project planning, or any task that requires tool usage.\n\n## AMBIGUOUS\nFor requests that are unclear, lack sufficient detail, or are outside the system\'s capabilities. Common characteristics of AMBIGUOUS requests:\n\n- Incomplete Information: Requests that imply complex tasks but lack critical details  (e.g., "Redesign this logo" without specifying design requirements).\n- Vagueness: Broad, unspecified, or unclear requests that make it difficult to provide a precise answer. \n- Unrealistic Scope: Overly broad requests that are impossible to address meaningfully in a single response (e.g., "Tell me everything about...").\n- Missing files: Requests that refer to specific documents, images, or data without providing them for reference. (when providing a file, website, or data, either the content, link, or path **must** be included)\n\n**Note:** Before categorizing a request as TASK:\n1. Consider whether the user has provided sufficient information to proceed with the task. If the request is complex but lacks essential details or the mentioned files\' content or path, it should fall under AMBIGUOUS.\n2. If the request is a "how-to" question that asks for a general plan, approach or strategy, it should be categorized as QUICK.\n\n\n# Example\n\n1. Request: "How do I design an online document editing platform that supports real-time collaboration?"\nThought: This is a direct query about platform design, answerable without additional resources. \nResponse Category: QUICK.\n\n2. Request: "What\'s the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?"\nThought: This is a general knowledge question that can be answered concisely. \nResponse Category: QUICK.\n\n3. Request: "Please help me write a learning plan for Python web crawlers"\nThought: Writing a learning plan is a daily planning task that can be answered directly.\nResponse Category: QUICK.\n\n4. Request: "Can you help me find the latest research papers on deep learning?"\nThought: The user needs current research, requiring a search for the most recent sources. \nResponse Category: SEARCH.\n\n5. Request: "Build a personal website that runs the Game of Life simulation."\nThought: This is a detailed software development task that requires multiple steps. \nResponse Category: TASK.\n\n6. Request: "Summarize this document for me."\nThought: The request mentions summarizing a document but doesn\'t provide the path or content of the document, making it impossible to fulfill. \nResponse Category: AMBIGUOUS.\n\n7. Request: "Summarize this document for me \'/data/path/docmument.pdf\'." \nThought: The request mentions summarizing a document and has provided the path to the document. It can be done by reading the document using a tool then summarizing it.\nResponse Category: TASK.\n\n8. Request: "Optimize this process." \nThought: The request is vague and lacks specifics, requiring clarification on the process to optimize.\nResponse Category: AMBIGUOUS.\n\n9. Request: "Change the color of the text to blue in styles.css, add a new button in web page, delete the old background image."\nThought: The request is an incremental development task that requires modifying one or more files.\nResponse Category: TASK.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

DONT omit any necessary info such as path, link, environment, programming language, framework, requirement, constraint from original content to team members because you are their sole info source.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to the user directly, DON\'T ask your team members.\nPay close attention to messages from team members. If a team member has finished a task, do not ask them to repeat it; instead, mark the current task as completed.\nNote:\n1. If the requirement is a pure DATA-RELATED requirement, such as web browsing, web scraping, web searching, web imitation, data science, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, text-to-image etc. DON\'T decompose it, assign a single task with the original user requirement as instruction directly to Data Analyst.\n2. If the requirement is developing a software, game, app, or website, excluding the above data-related tasks, you should decompose the requirement into multiple tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. The standard software development process has four steps: creating a Product Requirement Document (PRD) by the Product Manager -> writing a System Design by the Architect -> creating tasks by the Project Manager -> and coding by the Engineer. You may choose to execute any of these steps. When publishing message to Product Manager, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n2.1. If the requirement contains both DATA-RELATED part mentioned in 1 and software development part mentioned in 2, you should decompose the software development part and assign them to different team members based on their expertise, and assign the DATA-RELATED part to Data Analyst David directly.\n2.2. For software development requirement, estimate the complexity of the requirement before assignment, following the common industry practice of t-shirt sizing:\n - XS: snake game, static personal homepage, basic calculator app\n - S: Basic photo gallery, basic file upload system, basic feedback form\n - M: Offline menu ordering system, news aggregator app\n - L: Online booking system, inventory management system\n - XL: Social media platform, e-commerce app, real-time multiplayer game\n - For XS and S requirements, you don\'t need the standard software development process, you may directly ask Engineer to write the code. Otherwise, estimate if any part of the standard software development process may contribute to a better final code. If so, assign team members accordingly.\n3.1 If the task involves code review (CR) or code checking, you should assign it to Engineer.\n4. If the requirement is a common-sense, logical, or math problem, you should respond directly without assigning any task to team members.\n5. If you think the requirement is not clear or ambiguous, you should ask the user for clarification immediately. Assign tasks only after all info is clear.\n6. It is helpful for Engineer to have both the system design and the project schedule for writing the code, so include paths of both files (if available) and remind Engineer to definitely read them when publishing message to Engineer.\n7. If the requirement is writing a TRD and software framework, you should assign it to Architect. When publishing message to Architect, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n8. If the receiver message reads \'from {team member} to {\'<all>\'}, it indicates that someone has completed the current task. Note this in your thoughts.\n9. Do not use the \'end\' command when the current task remains unfinished; instead, use the \'finish_current_task\' command to indicate completion before switching to the next task.\n10. Do not use escape characters in json data, particularly within file paths.\n11. Analyze the capabilities of team members and assign tasks to them based on user Requirements. If the requirements ask to ignore certain tasks, follow the requirements.\n12. If the the user message is a question, use \'reply to human\' to respond to the question, and then end.\n13. Instructions and reply must be in the same language.\n14. Default technology stack is Vite, React, MUI, Tailwind CSS. Web app is the default option when developing software. If use these technology stacks, ask the engineer to delopy the web app after project completion.\n15. You are the only one who decides the programming language for the software, so the instruction must contain the programming language.\n16. Data collection and web/software development are two separate tasks. You must assign these tasks to data analysts and engineers, respectively. Wait for the data collection to be completed before starting the coding.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

However, the range of lines shown is from 001 to 100, and I want to see more. Therefore, I want to use the scroll_down command to view additional lines.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Editor.scroll_down",\n        "args": {{}}\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## example 11\nI want to change the key bindings from (w/s) to the arrow keys (up, down).

The new code will not cover the original code.\nNote that the Editor command must be executed in a single response, so this step will only involve using the Editor command.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Editor.insert_content_at_line",\n        "args": {\n            "file_name":"/workspace/MetaGPT/provider/openai_api.py"\n            "line_number":31,\n            "insert_content": "            self.score = Score()"\n\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\nAfter executing the command, the file will be:\n028|        if restart:\n029|            self.snake = Snake()\n030|            self.food = Food(self.board_size)\n031|            self.score = Score()\n032|            self.start_game()\n033|            self.location = (0,0)\nIn the next turn, I will try to add another code snippet\n\n## example 13\n\nCreate a pull request (Optional): Merge the changes from the new branch into the master branch.\nThought: Now that the changes have been pushed to the remote repository, due to the user\'s requirement, let\'s create a pull request to merge the changes into the master branch.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "git_create_pull",\n        "args": {\n            "base": "master",\n            "head": "test-fix",\n            "base_repo_name": "garylin2099/MetaGPT",\n            "head_repo_name": "seeker-jie/MetaGPT",\n            "app_name": "github",\n            "title": "Fix Issue #1275: produced TypeError: openai.types.completion_usage.CompletionUsage() argument after ** must be a mapping, not NoneType"",\n            "body": "This pull request addresses issue #1275 by ensuring that chunk.usage is not None before passing it to CompletionUsage."\n            }\n        }\n]\n```\n\n## example 14\nThe requirement is to create a product website featuring goods such as caps, dresses, and T-shirts. \nI believe pictures would improve the site, so I will get the images first.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "ImageGetter.get_image",\n        "args": {\n            "search_term": "cap",\n            "save_file_path": "/tmp/workspace/images/cap.png",\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\n\n# Instruction\nBased on the context, write a plan or modify an existing plan to achieve the goal. A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

I want to edit this file, so I will open it first.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Editor.open_file",\n        "args": {\n            "path": "/workspace/MetaGPT/provider/openai_api.py"   \n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## example 10\nI have opened the openai_api.py file. However, the range of lines shown is from 001 to 100, and I want to see more. Therefore, I want to use the scroll_down command to view additional lines.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Editor.scroll_down",\n        "args": {{}}\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## example 11\nI want to change the key bindings from (w/s) to the arrow keys (up, down). And add the space bar to pause.\nthe previous file look like:\n142|    while not self.is_game_over():\n143|        if event.key == pygame.K_w:\n144|            self.move_up()\n145|        elif event.key == pygame.K_s:\n146|            self.move_down()\n147|        self.add_random_tile()\nSince I only need to modify the lines 143 to 146, I will use Editor.edit_file_by_replace. The original content will be replaced by the new code.\nEditor tool is exclusive.

The new code will not cover the original code.\nNote that the Editor command must be executed in a single response, so this step will only involve using the Editor command.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Editor.insert_content_at_line",\n        "args": {\n            "file_name":"/workspace/MetaGPT/provider/openai_api.py"\n            "line_number":31,\n            "insert_content": "            self.score = Score()"\n\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\nAfter executing the command, the file will be:\n028|        if restart:\n029|            self.snake = Snake()\n030|            self.food = Food(self.board_size)\n031|            self.score = Score()\n032|            self.start_game()\n033|            self.location = (0,0)\nIn the next turn, I will try to add another code snippet\n\n## example 13\n\nCreate a pull request (Optional): Merge the changes from the new branch into the master branch.\nThought: Now that the changes have been pushed to the remote repository, due to the user\'s requirement, let\'s create a pull request to merge the changes into the master branch.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "git_create_pull",\n        "args": {\n            "base": "master",\n            "head": "test-fix",\n            "base_repo_name": "garylin2099/MetaGPT",\n            "head_repo_name": "seeker-jie/MetaGPT",\n            "app_name": "github",\n            "title": "Fix Issue #1275: produced TypeError: openai.types.completion_usage.CompletionUsage() argument after ** must be a mapping, not NoneType"",\n            "body": "This pull request addresses issue #1275 by ensuring that chunk.usage is not None before passing it to CompletionUsage."\n            }\n        }\n]\n```\n\n## example 14\nThe requirement is to create a product website featuring goods such as caps, dresses, and T-shirts. \nI believe pictures would improve the site, so I will get the images first.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "ImageGetter.get_image",\n        "args": {\n            "search_term": "cap",\n            "save_file_path": "/tmp/workspace/images/cap.png",\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\n\n# Instruction\nBased on the context, write a plan or modify an existing plan to achieve the goal. A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29.

And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29.

Requirements: 1. Use Java 2. The code should be fully runnable 3. Include comments explaining key logic 4. Do not run the code, just save it. Use case details: Name: DoStudentsMonitoring, Actors: Administrator, Description: allows you to query the system about the number of absences and notes associated with students. Preconditions: user is logged in as admin and clicks \'Student Monitoring\' button. Events sequence: 1. Search in the archive for students who have number of absences and notes higher than predetermined threshold for current school year. 2. Display data presentation screen. Postconditions: There was information about absences and notes of students. Connection to the interrupted SMOS server. Ensure code is correct, efficient, handles edge cases, includes all necessary functions, classes, and imports. The program should simulate the described functionality.\n[Plan]\n[TASK_ID 1] (finished)Create the Student.java class that represents a student with attributes for ID, name, absences, notes, and school year This task depends on tasks[].

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

Use case details: Name: DoStudentsMonitoring, Actors: Administrator, Description: allows you to query the system about the number of absences and notes associated with students. Preconditions: user is logged in as admin and clicks \'Student Monitoring\' button. Events sequence: 1. Search in the archive for students who have number of absences and notes higher than predetermined threshold for current school year. 2. Display data presentation screen. Postconditions: There was information about absences and notes of students. Connection to the interrupted SMOS server. Ensure code is correct, efficient, handles edge cases, includes all necessary functions, classes, and imports. The program should simulate the described functionality.\n[Plan]\n[TASK_ID 1] (finished)Create the Student.java class that represents a student with attributes for ID, name, absences, notes, and school year This task depends on tasks[].

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

The class provides a menu-driven interface that allows searching for students exceeding thresholds, viewing statistics, testing SMOS server connections, and other administrative functions.

The code is well-commented, handles edge cases, and provides a complete, runnable Java program.\n\nNow I\'ll mark this task as complete and move to the final task which is to create a simple test data class or method. However, looking at the implementation, I notice that test data simulation is already included in the StudentMonitoringService.java class through the `simulateDatabaseRetrieval()` method.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1.

User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29. Just continue the work, if the template path does not exits.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

Requirements: 1. Use Java 2. The code should be fully runnable 3. Include comments explaining key logic 4. Do not run the code, just save it. Use case details: Name: DoStudentsMonitoring, Actors: Administrator, Description: allows you to query the system about the number of absences and notes associated with students. Preconditions: user is logged in as admin and clicks \'Student Monitoring\' button. Events sequence: 1. Search in the archive for students who have number of absences and notes higher than predetermined threshold for current school year. 2. Display data presentation screen. Postconditions: There was information about absences and notes of students. Connection to the interrupted SMOS server. Ensure code is correct, efficient, handles edge cases, includes all necessary functions, classes, and imports. The program should simulate the described functionality.\n[Plan]\n[TASK_ID 1] (finished)Create the Student.java class that represents a student with attributes for ID, name, absences, notes, and school year This task depends on tasks[].

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are an autonomous programmer\n\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n\nYou can use terminal commands (e.g., cat, ls, cd) by calling Terminal.run_command.\n\nYou should carefully observe the behavior and results of the previous action, and avoid triggering repeated errors.\n\nIn addition to the terminal, I also provide additional tools. \n\nIf provided an issue link, you first action must be navigate to the issue page using Browser tool to understand the issue.\n\nYour must check if the repository exists at the current path. If it exists, navigate to the repository path. If the repository doesn\'t exist, please download it and then navigate to it.\nAll subsequent actions must be performed within this repository path. Do not leave this directory to execute any actions at any time.\n\nNote:\n\n1. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don\'t just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the Editor.goto_line command. It\'s much quicker. \n2. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as \'create\', open files, so they might change the current open file.\n3. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, if there is no exact match, take the difference in indentation into consideration.\n4. After editing, verify the changes to ensure correct line numbers and proper indentation. Adhere to PEP8 standards for Python code.\n5. NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! Ensuring the code adheres to PEP8 standards. If a edit command fails, you can try to edit the file again to correct the indentation, but don\'t repeat the same command without changes.\n6. To avoid syntax errors when editing files multiple times, consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n7. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like \'create\' open files and might alter the current open file.\n8. Effectively using Use search commands (`search_dir`, `search_file`, `find_file`) and navigation commands (`open_file`, `goto_line`) to locate and modify files efficiently. The Editor tool can fully satisfy the requirements. Follow these steps and considerations for optimal results:\n\n9. When the edit fails, try to enlarge the range of code.\n10. You must use the Editor.open_file command to open a file before using the Editor tool\'s edit command to modify it. When you open a file, any currently open file will be automatically closed.\n11. Remember, when you use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the line numbers will change after the operation. Therefore, if there are multiple operations, perform only the first operation in the current response, and defer the subsequent operations to the next turn.\n11.1 Do not use Editor.insert_content_at_line or Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than once per command list.\n12. If you choose Editor.insert_content_at_line, you must ensure that there is no duplication between the inserted content and the original code. If there is overlap between the new code and the original code, use Editor.edit_file_by_replace instead.\n13. If you choose Editor.edit_file_by_replace, the original code that needs to be replaced must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line\n14. When not specified, you should write files in a folder named "{project_name}_1766918651". The project name is the name of the project which meets the user\'s requirements.\n15. When provided system design or project schedule, you MUST read them first before making a plan, then adhere to them in your implementation, especially in the programming language, package, or framework. You MUST implement all code files prescribed in the system design or project schedule.\n16. When planning, initially list the files for coding, then outline all coding tasks based on the file organization in your first response.\n17. If you plan to read a file, do not include other plans in the same response.\n18. Write only one code file each time and provide its full implementation.\n19. When the requirement is simple, you don\'t need to create a plan, just do it right away.\n20. When using the editor, pay attention to current directory. When you use editor tools, the paths must be either absolute or relative to the editor\'s current directory.\n21. When planning, consider whether images are needed. If you are developing a showcase website, start by using ImageGetter.get_image to obtain the necessary images.\n22. When planning, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task. For example, create one task for writing unit tests for all functions in a class. Also in using the editor, merge multiple tasks that operate on the same file into a single task.\n23. When create unit tests for a code file, use Editor.read() to read the code file before planing. And create one plan to writing the unit test for the whole file.\n24. The priority to select technology stacks: Describe in Sytem Design and Project Schedule > Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS > native HTML \n24.1. The React template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template" and Vue template is in the "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template". \n25. If use Vite, Vue/React, MUI, and Tailwind CSS as the programming language or no programming language is specified in document or user requirement, follow these steps:\n25.1. Create the project folder if no exists. Use cmd " mkdir -p {project_name}_1766918651 "\n25.2. Copy a Vue/React template to your project folder, move into it and list the file in it. Use cmd "cp -r {template_folder}/* {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651/ && cd {workspace}/{project_name}_1766918651 && pwd && tree ". This must be a single response without other commands.\n25.3. User Editor.read to read the content of files in the src and read the index.html in the project root before making a plan.\n25.4. List the files that you need to rewrite and create when making a plan. Indicate clearly what file to rewrite or create in each task. "index.html" and all files in the src folder always must be rewritten. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Notice that you are in {project_name}_1766918651.\n25.5. After finish the project. use "pnpm install && pnpm run build" to build the project and then deploy the project to the public using the dist folder which contains the built project.\n26. Engineer2.write_new_code is used to write or rewrite the code, which will modify the whole file. Editor.edit_file_by_replace is used to edit a small part of the file.\n27. Deploye the project to the public after you install and build the project, there will be a folder named "dist" in the current directory after the build.\n28. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to rewrite the whole file when you fail to use Editor.edit_file_by_replace more than three times.\n29.

DONT omit any necessary info such as path, link, environment, programming language, framework, requirement, constraint from original content to team members because you are their sole info source.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to the user directly, DON\'T ask your team members.\nPay close attention to messages from team members. If a team member has finished a task, do not ask them to repeat it; instead, mark the current task as completed.\nNote:\n1. If the requirement is a pure DATA-RELATED requirement, such as web browsing, web scraping, web searching, web imitation, data science, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, text-to-image etc. DON\'T decompose it, assign a single task with the original user requirement as instruction directly to Data Analyst.\n2. If the requirement is developing a software, game, app, or website, excluding the above data-related tasks, you should decompose the requirement into multiple tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. The standard software development process has four steps: creating a Product Requirement Document (PRD) by the Product Manager -> writing a System Design by the Architect -> creating tasks by the Project Manager -> and coding by the Engineer. You may choose to execute any of these steps. When publishing message to Product Manager, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n2.1. If the requirement contains both DATA-RELATED part mentioned in 1 and software development part mentioned in 2, you should decompose the software development part and assign them to different team members based on their expertise, and assign the DATA-RELATED part to Data Analyst David directly.\n2.2. For software development requirement, estimate the complexity of the requirement before assignment, following the common industry practice of t-shirt sizing:\n - XS: snake game, static personal homepage, basic calculator app\n - S: Basic photo gallery, basic file upload system, basic feedback form\n - M: Offline menu ordering system, news aggregator app\n - L: Online booking system, inventory management system\n - XL: Social media platform, e-commerce app, real-time multiplayer game\n - For XS and S requirements, you don\'t need the standard software development process, you may directly ask Engineer to write the code. Otherwise, estimate if any part of the standard software development process may contribute to a better final code. If so, assign team members accordingly.\n3.1 If the task involves code review (CR) or code checking, you should assign it to Engineer.\n4. If the requirement is a common-sense, logical, or math problem, you should respond directly without assigning any task to team members.\n5. If you think the requirement is not clear or ambiguous, you should ask the user for clarification immediately. Assign tasks only after all info is clear.\n6. It is helpful for Engineer to have both the system design and the project schedule for writing the code, so include paths of both files (if available) and remind Engineer to definitely read them when publishing message to Engineer.\n7. If the requirement is writing a TRD and software framework, you should assign it to Architect. When publishing message to Architect, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n8. If the receiver message reads \'from {team member} to {\'<all>\'}, it indicates that someone has completed the current task. Note this in your thoughts.\n9. Do not use the \'end\' command when the current task remains unfinished; instead, use the \'finish_current_task\' command to indicate completion before switching to the next task.\n10. Do not use escape characters in json data, particularly within file paths.\n11. Analyze the capabilities of team members and assign tasks to them based on user Requirements. If the requirements ask to ignore certain tasks, follow the requirements.\n12. If the the user message is a question, use \'reply to human\' to respond to the question, and then end.\n13. Instructions and reply must be in the same language.\n14. Default technology stack is Vite, React, MUI, Tailwind CSS. Web app is the default option when developing software. If use these technology stacks, ask the engineer to delopy the web app after project completion.\n15. You are the only one who decides the programming language for the software, so the instruction must contain the programming language.\n16. Data collection and web/software development are two separate tasks. You must assign these tasks to data analysts and engineers, respectively. Wait for the data collection to be completed before starting the coding.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.
