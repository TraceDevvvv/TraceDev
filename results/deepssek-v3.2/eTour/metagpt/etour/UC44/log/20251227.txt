The current time is 2025-12-27 20:54:13.\nYour team member:\nMike: Team Leader, Manage a team to assist users\nAlice: Product Manager, Create a Product Requirement Document or market research/competitive product research.\nBob: Architect, design a concise, usable, complete software system. output the system design.\nAlex: Engineer, Take on game, app, web development and deployment.\nDavid: DataAnalyst, Take on any data-related tasks, such as data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, web browsing, web scraping, web searching, terminal operation, document QA & analysis, etc.\n\n\nYour role is to determine the appropriate response category for the given request.\n\n# Response Categories\n## QUICK: \nFor straightforward questions or requests that can be answered directly. This includes common-sense inquiries, legal or logical questions, basic math, short coding tasks, multiple-choice questions, greetings, casual chat, daily planning, and inquiries about you or your team.\n\n## SEARCH\nFor queries that require retrieving up-to-date or detailed information. This includes time-sensitive or location-specific questions like current events or weather. Use this only if the information isn\'t readily available.\nIf a file or link is provided, you don\'t need to search for additional information.\n\n## TASK\nFor requests that involve tool utilizations, computer operations, multiple steps or detailed instructions. Examples include software development, project planning, or any task that requires tool usage.\n\n## AMBIGUOUS\nFor requests that are unclear, lack sufficient detail, or are outside the system\'s capabilities. Common characteristics of AMBIGUOUS requests:\n\n- Incomplete Information: Requests that imply complex tasks but lack critical details  (e.g., "Redesign this logo" without specifying design requirements).\n- Vagueness: Broad, unspecified, or unclear requests that make it difficult to provide a precise answer. \n- Unrealistic Scope: Overly broad requests that are impossible to address meaningfully in a single response (e.g., "Tell me everything about...").\n- Missing files: Requests that refer to specific documents, images, or data without providing them for reference. (when providing a file, website, or data, either the content, link, or path **must** be included)\n\n**Note:** Before categorizing a request as TASK:\n1. Consider whether the user has provided sufficient information to proceed with the task. If the request is complex but lacks essential details or the mentioned files\' content or path, it should fall under AMBIGUOUS.\n2. If the request is a "how-to" question that asks for a general plan, approach or strategy, it should be categorized as QUICK.\n\n\n# Example\n\n1. Request: "How do I design an online document editing platform that supports real-time collaboration?"\nThought: This is a direct query about platform design, answerable without additional resources. \nResponse Category: QUICK.\n\n2. Request: "What\'s the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?"\nThought: This is a general knowledge question that can be answered concisely. \nResponse Category: QUICK.\n\n3. Request: "Please help me write a learning plan for Python web crawlers"\nThought: Writing a learning plan is a daily planning task that can be answered directly.\nResponse Category: QUICK.\n\n4. Request: "Can you help me find the latest research papers on deep learning?"\nThought: The user needs current research, requiring a search for the most recent sources. \nResponse Category: SEARCH.\n\n5. Request: "Build a personal website that runs the Game of Life simulation."\nThought: This is a detailed software development task that requires multiple steps. \nResponse Category: TASK.\n\n6. Request: "Summarize this document for me."\nThought: The request mentions summarizing a document but doesn\'t provide the path or content of the document, making it impossible to fulfill. \nResponse Category: AMBIGUOUS.\n\n7. Request: "Summarize this document for me \'/data/path/docmument.pdf\'." \nThought: The request mentions summarizing a document and has provided the path to the document. It can be done by reading the document using a tool then summarizing it.\nResponse Category: TASK.\n\n8. Request: "Optimize this process." \nThought: The request is vague and lacks specifics, requiring clarification on the process to optimize.\nResponse Category: AMBIGUOUS.\n\n9. Request: "Change the color of the text to blue in styles.css, add a new button in web page, delete the old background image."\nThought: The request is an incremental development task that requires modifying one or more files.\nResponse Category: TASK.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

DONT omit any necessary info such as path, link, environment, programming language, framework, requirement, constraint from original content to team members because you are their sole info source.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to the user directly, DON\'T ask your team members.\nPay close attention to messages from team members. If a team member has finished a task, do not ask them to repeat it; instead, mark the current task as completed.\nNote:\n1. If the requirement is a pure DATA-RELATED requirement, such as web browsing, web scraping, web searching, web imitation, data science, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, text-to-image etc. DON\'T decompose it, assign a single task with the original user requirement as instruction directly to Data Analyst.\n2. If the requirement is developing a software, game, app, or website, excluding the above data-related tasks, you should decompose the requirement into multiple tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. The standard software development process has four steps: creating a Product Requirement Document (PRD) by the Product Manager -> writing a System Design by the Architect -> creating tasks by the Project Manager -> and coding by the Engineer. You may choose to execute any of these steps. When publishing message to Product Manager, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n2.1. If the requirement contains both DATA-RELATED part mentioned in 1 and software development part mentioned in 2, you should decompose the software development part and assign them to different team members based on their expertise, and assign the DATA-RELATED part to Data Analyst David directly.\n2.2. For software development requirement, estimate the complexity of the requirement before assignment, following the common industry practice of t-shirt sizing:\n - XS: snake game, static personal homepage, basic calculator app\n - S: Basic photo gallery, basic file upload system, basic feedback form\n - M: Offline menu ordering system, news aggregator app\n - L: Online booking system, inventory management system\n - XL: Social media platform, e-commerce app, real-time multiplayer game\n - For XS and S requirements, you don\'t need the standard software development process, you may directly ask Engineer to write the code. Otherwise, estimate if any part of the standard software development process may contribute to a better final code. If so, assign team members accordingly.\n3.1 If the task involves code review (CR) or code checking, you should assign it to Engineer.\n4. If the requirement is a common-sense, logical, or math problem, you should respond directly without assigning any task to team members.\n5. If you think the requirement is not clear or ambiguous, you should ask the user for clarification immediately. Assign tasks only after all info is clear.\n6. It is helpful for Engineer to have both the system design and the project schedule for writing the code, so include paths of both files (if available) and remind Engineer to definitely read them when publishing message to Engineer.\n7. If the requirement is writing a TRD and software framework, you should assign it to Architect. When publishing message to Architect, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n8. If the receiver message reads \'from {team member} to {\'<all>\'}, it indicates that someone has completed the current task. Note this in your thoughts.\n9. Do not use the \'end\' command when the current task remains unfinished; instead, use the \'finish_current_task\' command to indicate completion before switching to the next task.\n10. Do not use escape characters in json data, particularly within file paths.\n11. Analyze the capabilities of team members and assign tasks to them based on user Requirements. If the requirements ask to ignore certain tasks, follow the requirements.\n12. If the the user message is a question, use \'reply to human\' to respond to the question, and then end.\n13. Instructions and reply must be in the same language.\n14. Default technology stack is Vite, React, MUI, Tailwind CSS. Web app is the default option when developing software.

Example:\n```mermaid\nquadrantChart\n    title "Reach and engagement of campaigns"\n    x-axis "Low Reach" --> "High Reach"\n    y-axis "Low Engagement" --> "High Engagement"\n    quadrant-1 "We should expand"\n    quadrant-2 "Need to promote"\n    quadrant-3 "Re-evaluate"\n    quadrant-4 "May be improved"\n    "Campaign A": [0.3, 0.6]\n    "Campaign B": [0.45, 0.23]\n    "Campaign C": [0.57, 0.69]\n    "Campaign D": [0.78, 0.34]\n    "Campaign E": [0.40, 0.34]\n    "Campaign F": [0.35, 0.78]\n    "Our Target Product": [0.5, 0.6]\n```\n\n### PRD Document Guidelines\n- Use clear requirement language (Must/Should/May)\n- Include measurable criteria\n- Prioritize clearly (P0: Must-have, P1: Should-have, P2: Nice-to-have)\n- Support with diagrams and charts\n- Focus on user value and business goals\n\n## Mode 2: Market Research\nTriggered by market analysis or competitor research requests, ending with the output of a complete report document.\n\n### **IMPORTANT** Information Collection Requirements\n\nMust follow this strict information gathering process:\n1. Keyword Generation Rules:\n   - Infer 3 distinct keyword groups on user needs(Infer directly instead of using tools).\n   - Each group must be a space-separated phrase containing:\n     * Target industry/product name (REQUIRED)\n     * Specific aspect or metric\n     * Time frame or geographic scope when relevant\n\n   Example format:\n   - Group 1: "electric vehicles market size forecast 2024"\n   - Group 2: "electric vehicles manufacturing costs analysis"\n   - Group 3: "electric vehicles consumer preferences survey"\n\n2. Search Process:\n   - For each keyword:\n     * Use SearchEnhancedQA TOOL (SearchEnhancedQA.run) collect top 3 search results\n     * Remove duplicate URLs\n   \n3. Information Analysis:\n   - Must read and analyze EACH unique source individually\n   - Synthesize information across all sources\n   - Cross-reference and verify key data points\n   - Identify critical insights and trends\n\n4. Quality Control:\n   - Verify data consistency across sources\n   - Fill information gaps with targeted additional research\n   - Ensure balanced perspective from multiple sources\n\n\n### Report Structure\n1.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are a product manager AI assistant specializing in product requirement documentation and market research analysis. \nYour work focuses on the analysis of problems and data.\nYou should always output a document.\n\n## Core Tools\n1.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are a product manager AI assistant specializing in product requirement documentation and market research analysis. \nYour work focuses on the analysis of problems and data.\nYou should always output a document.\n\n## Core Tools\n1.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are a product manager AI assistant specializing in product requirement documentation and market research analysis. \nYour work focuses on the analysis of problems and data.\nYou should always output a document.\n\n## Core Tools\n1.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are a product manager AI assistant specializing in product requirement documentation and market research analysis. \nYour work focuses on the analysis of problems and data.\nYou should always output a document.\n\n## Core Tools\n1.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are a product manager AI assistant specializing in product requirement documentation and market research analysis. \nYour work focuses on the analysis of problems and data.\nYou should always output a document.\n\n## Core Tools\n1.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don\'t forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are a product manager AI assistant specializing in product requirement documentation and market research analysis. \nYour work focuses on the analysis of problems and data.\nYou should always output a document.\n\n## Core Tools\n1.

The message content should contain important path info.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Plan.finish_current_task",\n        "args": {}\n    },\n    {\n        "command_name": "TeamLeader.publish_message",\n            "args": {\n                "content": "Please design the software architecture for the snake game based on the PRD created by Alice. The PRD is at \'/tmp/workspace/snake_game/docs/prd.json\'.",\n                "send_to": "Bob"\n            }\n    },\n    {\n        "command_name": "RoleZero.reply_to_human",\n        "args": {\n            "content": "Alice has completed the PRD. I have marked her task as finished and sent the PRD to Bob. Bob will work on the software architecture."\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        "command_name": "end"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## example 4\nUser Question: how does the project go?\nExplanation: The user is asking for a general update on the project status. Give a straight answer about the current task the team is working on and provide a summary of the completed tasks.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "RoleZero.reply_to_human",\n        "args": {\n            "content": "The team is currently working on ... We have completed ..."\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        "command_name": "end"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## example 5\nOBSERVATION : current task is none and all task is finished.\nExplanation: Last task is "Plan.finish_current_task" or \'RoleZero.reply_to_human\' and now the current task is none, it means everything is done.Just coutput command "end".\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "end"\n    }\n]\n\n## example 6\nOBSERVATION : The previously completed task is identical to the current task.\nExplanation: The current task has been accomplished previously.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Plan.finish_current_task",\n        "args": {}\n    },\n]\n```\n\n## example 7\nOBSERVATION : the task assigned to Alice is still ongoing as it has not been marked as finished. The current task in the plan is for Alice to create the PRD.\nExplanation: "I attempted to locate historical records containing \'send to [<all>]\', and discovered an entry stating \'PRD is finished and masked.\' This indicates that Alice\'s task has been completed.\n```json\n[\n    {\n        "command_name": "Plan.finish_current_task",\n        "args": {}\n    },\n]\n```\n\n\n# Instruction\nYou are a team leader, and you are responsible for drafting tasks and routing tasks to your team members.\nYour team member:\nMike: Team Leader, Manage a team to assist users\nAlice: Product Manager, Create a Product Requirement Document or market research/competitive product research.\nBob: Architect, design a concise, usable, complete software system. output the system design.\nAlex: Engineer, Take on game, app, web development and deployment.\nDavid: DataAnalyst, Take on any data-related tasks, such as data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, web browsing, web scraping, web searching, terminal operation, document QA & analysis, etc.\n\nYou should NOT assign consecutive tasks to the same team member, instead, assign an aggregated task (or the complete requirement) and let the team member to decompose it.\nWhen drafting and routing tasks, ALWAYS include necessary or important info inside the instruction, such as path, link, environment to team members, because you are their sole info source.\nEach time you do something, reply to human letting them know what you did.\nWhen creating a new plan involving multiple members, create all tasks at once.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress based on team member feedback message, and update plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nYou should use TeamLeader.publish_team_message to team members, asking them to start their task. DONT omit any necessary info such as path, link, environment, programming language, framework, requirement, constraint from original content to team members because you are their sole info source.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to the user directly, DON\'T ask your team members.\nPay close attention to messages from team members. If a team member has finished a task, do not ask them to repeat it; instead, mark the current task as completed.\nNote:\n1. If the requirement is a pure DATA-RELATED requirement, such as web browsing, web scraping, web searching, web imitation, data science, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, text-to-image etc. DON\'T decompose it, assign a single task with the original user requirement as instruction directly to Data Analyst.\n2. If the requirement is developing a software, game, app, or website, excluding the above data-related tasks, you should decompose the requirement into multiple tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. The standard software development process has four steps: creating a Product Requirement Document (PRD) by the Product Manager -> writing a System Design by the Architect -> creating tasks by the Project Manager -> and coding by the Engineer. You may choose to execute any of these steps. When publishing message to Product Manager, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n2.1. If the requirement contains both DATA-RELATED part mentioned in 1 and software development part mentioned in 2, you should decompose the software development part and assign them to different team members based on their expertise, and assign the DATA-RELATED part to Data Analyst David directly.\n2.2. For software development requirement, estimate the complexity of the requirement before assignment, following the common industry practice of t-shirt sizing:\n - XS: snake game, static personal homepage, basic calculator app\n - S: Basic photo gallery, basic file upload system, basic feedback form\n - M: Offline menu ordering system, news aggregator app\n - L: Online booking system, inventory management system\n - XL: Social media platform, e-commerce app, real-time multiplayer game\n - For XS and S requirements, you don\'t need the standard software development process, you may directly ask Engineer to write the code. Otherwise, estimate if any part of the standard software development process may contribute to a better final code. If so, assign team members accordingly.\n3.1 If the task involves code review (CR) or code checking, you should assign it to Engineer.\n4. If the requirement is a common-sense, logical, or math problem, you should respond directly without assigning any task to team members.\n5. If you think the requirement is not clear or ambiguous, you should ask the user for clarification immediately. Assign tasks only after all info is clear.\n6. It is helpful for Engineer to have both the system design and the project schedule for writing the code, so include paths of both files (if available) and remind Engineer to definitely read them when publishing message to Engineer.\n7. If the requirement is writing a TRD and software framework, you should assign it to Architect. When publishing message to Architect, you should directly copy the full original user requirement.\n8. If the receiver message reads \'from {team member} to {\'<all>\'}, it indicates that someone has completed the current task. Note this in your thoughts.\n9. Do not use the \'end\' command when the current task remains unfinished; instead, use the \'finish_current_task\' command to indicate completion before switching to the next task.\n10. Do not use escape characters in json data, particularly within file paths.\n11. Analyze the capabilities of team members and assign tasks to them based on user Requirements. If the requirements ask to ignore certain tasks, follow the requirements.\n12. If the the user message is a question, use \'reply to human\' to respond to the question, and then end.\n13. Instructions and reply must be in the same language.\n14. Default technology stack is Vite, React, MUI, Tailwind CSS. Web app is the default option when developing software. If use these technology stacks, ask the engineer to delopy the web app after project completion.\n15. You are the only one who decides the programming language for the software, so the instruction must contain the programming language.\n16. Data collection and web/software development are two separate tasks. You must assign these tasks to data analysts and engineers, respectively. Wait for the data collection to be completed before starting the coding.\n\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '[Message] from User to Mike: \n\nBased on the following use case, write a complete program in Java.

React template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template and Vue template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template. \n3. Execute "mkdir -p {project_name} && tree /path/of/the/template" to clear template structure if you want to use template. This must be a single response WITHOUT other commands. \n4. The system design must adhere to the following rules:\n4.1 Chapter in the system design should include: \nImplementation approach: Analyze the difficult points of the requirements, select the appropriate open-source framework.\nFile list: Only need relative paths. If using template, index.html and the file in src folder must be included.\nData structures and interfaces: Use mermaid classDiagram code syntax, including classes, method(__init__ etc.) and functions with type annotations, CLEARLY MARK the RELATIONSHIPS between classes, and comply with PEP8 standards. The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\nProgram call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\nAnything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4.2 System Design Format example:\n\n```markdown\n## Implementation approach": \n\nWe will ...\n\n## File list\n\n- a.jsx\n- b.jx\n- c.py\n- d.css\n- e.html\n\n## Data structures and interfaces:\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        <<entry point>>\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class SearchEngine {\n        +search(query: str) str\n    }\n    class Index {\n        +create_index(data: dict)\n        +query_index(query: str) list\n    }\n    class Ranking {\n        +rank_results(results: list) list\n}\n\n## Program call flow:\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant SE as SearchEngine\n    participant I as Index\n    participant R as Ranking\n    participant S as Summary\n    participant KB as KnowledgeBase\n    M->>SE: search(query)\n    SE->>I: query_index(query)\n    I->>KB: fetch_data(query)\n    KB-->>I: return data\n\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n\nClarification needed on third-party API integration, ...\n\n```\n\n5. Use Editor.write to write the system design in markdown format. The file path must be "{project}/docs/system_design.md". Use command_name "end" when the system design is finished.\n6. If not memtioned, always use Editor.write to write "Program call flow" in a new file name "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid" and write "Data structures and interfaces" in a new file "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid-class-diagram".

Your task is to design a software system that meets the requirements.\n\nNote:\n1. If Product Requirement Document is provided, read the document and use it as the requirement. If the Programming Language in PRD is Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS, use the template.\n2. Default programming language is Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS. React template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template and Vue template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template. \n3. Execute "mkdir -p {project_name} && tree /path/of/the/template" to clear template structure if you want to use template. This must be a single response WITHOUT other commands. \n4. The system design must adhere to the following rules:\n4.1 Chapter in the system design should include: \nImplementation approach: Analyze the difficult points of the requirements, select the appropriate open-source framework.\nFile list: Only need relative paths. If using template, index.html and the file in src folder must be included.\nData structures and interfaces: Use mermaid classDiagram code syntax, including classes, method(__init__ etc.) and functions with type annotations, CLEARLY MARK the RELATIONSHIPS between classes, and comply with PEP8 standards. The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\nProgram call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\nAnything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4.2 System Design Format example:\n\n```markdown\n## Implementation approach": \n\nWe will ...\n\n## File list\n\n- a.jsx\n- b.jx\n- c.py\n- d.css\n- e.html\n\n## Data structures and interfaces:\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        <<entry point>>\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class SearchEngine {\n        +search(query: str) str\n    }\n    class Index {\n        +create_index(data: dict)\n        +query_index(query: str) list\n    }\n    class Ranking {\n        +rank_results(results: list) list\n}\n\n## Program call flow:\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant SE as SearchEngine\n    participant I as Index\n    participant R as Ranking\n    participant S as Summary\n    participant KB as KnowledgeBase\n    M->>SE: search(query)\n    SE->>I: query_index(query)\n    I->>KB: fetch_data(query)\n    KB-->>I: return data\n\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n\nClarification needed on third-party API integration, ...\n\n```\n\n5. Use Editor.write to write the system design in markdown format. The file path must be "{project}/docs/system_design.md". Use command_name "end" when the system design is finished.\n6. If not memtioned, always use Editor.write to write "Program call flow" in a new file name "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid" and write "Data structures and interfaces" in a new file "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid-class-diagram". Mermaid code only. Do not add "```mermaid".\n7.

Your task is to design a software system that meets the requirements.\n\nNote:\n1. If Product Requirement Document is provided, read the document and use it as the requirement. If the Programming Language in PRD is Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS, use the template.\n2. Default programming language is Vite, React, MUI and Tailwind CSS. React template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template and Vue template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template. \n3. Execute "mkdir -p {project_name} && tree /path/of/the/template" to clear template structure if you want to use template. This must be a single response WITHOUT other commands. \n4. The system design must adhere to the following rules:\n4.1 Chapter in the system design should include: \nImplementation approach: Analyze the difficult points of the requirements, select the appropriate open-source framework.\nFile list: Only need relative paths. If using template, index.html and the file in src folder must be included.\nData structures and interfaces: Use mermaid classDiagram code syntax, including classes, method(__init__ etc.) and functions with type annotations, CLEARLY MARK the RELATIONSHIPS between classes, and comply with PEP8 standards. The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\nProgram call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\nAnything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4.2 System Design Format example:\n\n```markdown\n## Implementation approach": \n\nWe will ...\n\n## File list\n\n- a.jsx\n- b.jx\n- c.py\n- d.css\n- e.html\n\n## Data structures and interfaces:\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        <<entry point>>\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class SearchEngine {\n        +search(query: str) str\n    }\n    class Index {\n        +create_index(data: dict)\n        +query_index(query: str) list\n    }\n    class Ranking {\n        +rank_results(results: list) list\n}\n\n## Program call flow:\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant SE as SearchEngine\n    participant I as Index\n    participant R as Ranking\n    participant S as Summary\n    participant KB as KnowledgeBase\n    M->>SE: search(query)\n    SE->>I: query_index(query)\n    I->>KB: fetch_data(query)\n    KB-->>I: return data\n\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n\nClarification needed on third-party API integration, ...\n\n```\n\n5. Use Editor.write to write the system design in markdown format. The file path must be "{project}/docs/system_design.md". Use command_name "end" when the system design is finished.\n6. If not memtioned, always use Editor.write to write "Program call flow" in a new file name "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid" and write "Data structures and interfaces" in a new file "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid-class-diagram". Mermaid code only. Do not add "```mermaid".\n7.

React template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/react_template and Vue template is in /home///baselines/MetaGPT/template/vue_template. \n3. Execute "mkdir -p {project_name} && tree /path/of/the/template" to clear template structure if you want to use template. This must be a single response WITHOUT other commands. \n4. The system design must adhere to the following rules:\n4.1 Chapter in the system design should include: \nImplementation approach: Analyze the difficult points of the requirements, select the appropriate open-source framework.\nFile list: Only need relative paths. If using template, index.html and the file in src folder must be included.\nData structures and interfaces: Use mermaid classDiagram code syntax, including classes, method(__init__ etc.) and functions with type annotations, CLEARLY MARK the RELATIONSHIPS between classes, and comply with PEP8 standards. The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\nProgram call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\nAnything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4.2 System Design Format example:\n\n```markdown\n## Implementation approach": \n\nWe will ...\n\n## File list\n\n- a.jsx\n- b.jx\n- c.py\n- d.css\n- e.html\n\n## Data structures and interfaces:\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        <<entry point>>\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class SearchEngine {\n        +search(query: str) str\n    }\n    class Index {\n        +create_index(data: dict)\n        +query_index(query: str) list\n    }\n    class Ranking {\n        +rank_results(results: list) list\n}\n\n## Program call flow:\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant SE as SearchEngine\n    participant I as Index\n    participant R as Ranking\n    participant S as Summary\n    participant KB as KnowledgeBase\n    M->>SE: search(query)\n    SE->>I: query_index(query)\n    I->>KB: fetch_data(query)\n    KB-->>I: return data\n\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n\nClarification needed on third-party API integration, ...\n\n```\n\n5. Use Editor.write to write the system design in markdown format. The file path must be "{project}/docs/system_design.md". Use command_name "end" when the system design is finished.\n6. If not memtioned, always use Editor.write to write "Program call flow" in a new file name "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid" and write "Data structures and interfaces" in a new file "{project}/docs/system_design-sequence-diagram.mermaid-class-diagram". Mermaid code only. Do not add "```mermaid".\n7.

不明确的事项\n\n基于PRD文档，以下方面需要进一步澄清：\n\n1. **ETOUR服务器接口规范**：需要明确ETOUR服务器的具体API端点、请求格式、响应格式、认证方式和错误码定义。\n\n2. **协议数据的具体字段**：需要明确协议表单的完整字段列表、数据类型、必填/选填规则、字段长度限制和格式要求。\n\n3. **错误处理的具体场景**：需要详细定义各种错误场景（如网络超时、服务器错误、数据格式错误等）的具体处理策略和用户反馈信息。\n\n4. **用户权限和角色管理**：需要明确不同角色（操作员、管理员、机构人员）的具体权限范围和操作限制。\n\n5. **数据备份和恢复策略**：需要明确数据备份频率、备份存储位置、恢复流程和灾难恢复计划。\n\n6. **性能指标的具体要求**：需要明确系统负载能力、并发用户数、响应时间SLA等具体性能指标。\n\n7. **合规性要求细节**：需要明确
2025-12-27 21:07:43.067 | WARNING  | metagpt.utils.role_zero_utils:parse_commands:115 - Failed to parse JSON for: 基于PRD文档内容，我需要为ConventionRequest系统设计一个完整的Java系统架构。PRD文档已经详细描述了需求，包括用户认证、表单显示、数据验证、错误处理、确认流程和网络请求等功能。我将采用分层架构（MVC模式），使用Spring Boot框架，设计一个完整的系统。

首先，我将创建项目目录结构，然后编写详细的系统设计文档。

data\n基于PRD文档内容，我需要为ConventionRequest系统设计一个完整的Java系统架构。PRD文档已经详细描述了需求，包括用户认证、表单显示、数据验证、错误处理、确认流程和网络请求等功能。我将采用分层架构（MVC模式），使用Spring Boot框架，设计一个完整的系统。\n\n首先，我将创建项目目录结构，然后编写详细的系统设计文档。\n\n```json\n[\n

"path": "/home///baselines/MetaGPT/workspace/convention_request_system/docs/system_design.md",\n            "content": "# ConventionRequest 系统架构设计\\n\\n## 实现方法\\n\\n基于PRD文档的需求分析，我们将采用以下技术栈和架构模式：\\n\\n### 技术选型\\n1. **后端框架**: Spring Boot 3.x - 提供快速开发和完整的生态系统\\n2. **安全框架**: Spring Security 6.x - 处理用户认证和授权\\n3. **数据持久化**: Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL - 关系型数据库存储\\n4. **验证框架**: Hibernate Validator + 自定义验证器 - 数据验证\\n5. **API设计**: RESTful API - 前后端分离架构\\n6. **构建工具**: Maven - 项目依赖管理\\n7. **测试框架**: JUnit 5 + Mockito - 单元测试和集成测试\\n8. **文档生成**: SpringDoc OpenAPI - API文档自动生成\\n\\n### 架构模式\\n采用**分层架构**（MVC变体），包含以下层次：\\n1. **表示层 (Presentation Layer)**: 处理HTTP请求和响应\\n2. **业务逻辑层 (Service Layer)**: 实现核心业务逻辑\\n3. **数据访问层 (Data Access Layer)**: 数据库操作和持久化\\n4. **外部集成层 (Integration Layer)**: 与ETOUR服务器通信\\n\\n### 关键设计决策\\n1. **认证机制**: 使用JWT令牌进行无状态认证，支持会话管理\\n2. **数据验证**: 多级验证策略（前端轻量验证 + 后端完整验证）\\n3. **错误处理**: 统一异常处理机制，返回标准化的错误响应\\n4. **事务管理**: 使用Spring声明式事务管理，确保数据一致性\\n5. **异步处理**: 对ETOUR服务器调用采用异步机制，提高响应速度\\n\\n## 文件列表\\n\\n### 核心Java类文件\\n- `src/main/java/com/convention/request/ConventionRequestApplication.java` - 应用启动类\\n-

不明确的事项\n\n基于PRD文档，以下方面需要进一步澄清：\n\n1. **ETOUR服务器接口规范**：需要明确ETOUR服务器的具体API端点、请求格式、响应格式、认证方式和错误码定义。\n\n2. **协议数据的具体字段**：需要明确协议表单的完整字段列表、数据类型、必填/选填规则、字段长度限制和格式要求。\n\n3. **错误处理的具体场景**：需要详细定义各种错误场景（如网络超时、服务器错误、数据格式错误等）的具体处理策略和用户反馈信息。\n\n4. **用户权限和角色管理**：需要明确不同角色（操作员、管理员、机构人员）的具体权限范围和操作限制。\n\n5. **数据备份和恢复策略**：需要明确数据备份频率、备份存储位置、恢复流程和灾难恢复计划。\n\n6. **性能指标的具体要求**：需要明确系统负载能力、并发用户数、响应时间SLA等具体性能指标。\n\n7. **合规性要求细节**：需要明确
