# Java version requirement
Java Development Kit (JDK) >= 11

# This project uses Java Swing (javax.swing) which is included in standard Java libraries.
# No external dependencies are required beyond the standard Java Runtime Environment.

# Build and run instructions:
# 1. Compile all .java files:
#    javac culturalheritage/search/*.java
# 2. Run the application:
#    java culturalheritage.search.MainApp

# Alternatively, if using an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA):
# - Create a new Java project.
# - Import the 'culturalheritage.search' package with all Java files.
# - Ensure the project SDK is set to Java 11 or later.
# - Run MainApp.java as the main class.

# The application is a standalone Java GUI application using built-in Swing libraries.
# No Maven, Gradle, or external dependencies are needed.
