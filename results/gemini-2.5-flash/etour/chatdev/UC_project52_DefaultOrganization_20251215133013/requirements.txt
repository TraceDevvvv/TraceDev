# This is a Java project and does not have Python-specific dependencies that would be listed in a requirements.txt file.
# The project relies solely on the Java Development Kit (JDK) for compilation and execution.
# No external Java libraries are used beyond the standard Java API (e.g., javax.swing, java.util).
