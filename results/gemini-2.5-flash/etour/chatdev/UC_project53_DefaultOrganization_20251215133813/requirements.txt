# This project is written in Java and utilizes standard Java libraries (e.g., Swing, AWT, java.util).
# For Java projects, dependencies on external libraries (beyond the Java Development Kit itself) are typically managed
# using build tools like Apache Maven (via a pom.xml file) or Gradle (via a build.gradle file).
#
# This specific application does not appear to use any custom third-party JAR files or external libraries
# that would need to be explicitly listed as a 'requirement' in the way Python projects use requirements.txt.
#
# To run this project, you primarily need a Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher is generally recommended
# for Swing applications, but a specific minimum version is not explicitly stated in the source code.
# Assuming JDK 8 or newer:
#
# Primary requirement:
# - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8+
#
# No other external libraries or packages are explicitly identified as dependencies
# that would typically be listed in a Python-style requirements.txt.
