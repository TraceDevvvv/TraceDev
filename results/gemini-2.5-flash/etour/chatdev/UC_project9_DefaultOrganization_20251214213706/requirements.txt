# This project is a Java application.
# Unlike Python projects that use a requirements.txt file, Java projects typically manage dependencies
# using build tools like Maven (pom.xml) or Gradle (build.gradle).
#
# The provided Java code uses only standard Java Development Kit (JDK) libraries,
# primarily for GUI (Swing) and core utilities.
# There are no external third-party libraries or frameworks explicitly used that would
# necessitate listing them as dependencies in a file like requirements.txt.
#
# To run this project, you only need a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (e.g., JDK 8 or newer).
#
# If this were a project with external dependencies (e.g., Spring Boot, Hibernate, Apache Commons),
# a Maven `pom.xml` or Gradle `build.gradle` file would contain those dependency declarations.
