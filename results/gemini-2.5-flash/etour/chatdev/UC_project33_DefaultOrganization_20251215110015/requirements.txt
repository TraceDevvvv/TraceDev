# This is a Java project and uses standard Java Development Kit (JDK) libraries only.
# No external dependencies are required beyond a compatible JDK.
# Therefore, a 'requirements.txt' file, typically used for Python projects, is not applicable
# in the standard sense for this pure Java application with no third-party libraries.
# If this were a Maven or Gradle project, dependencies would be listed in pom.xml or build.gradle.
