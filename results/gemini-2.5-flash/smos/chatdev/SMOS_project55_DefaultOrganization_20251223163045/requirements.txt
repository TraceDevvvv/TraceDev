# This project is written in Java and primarily uses standard Java libraries
# (such as javax.swing for GUI, java.awt, and java.util for data structures).
#
# In Java, external dependencies are typically managed using build tools like
# Maven (pom.xml) or Gradle (build.gradle), not a 'requirements.txt' file
# in the style of Python projects.
#
# Since this application uses only core Java APIs, no additional external
# libraries or third-party dependencies are required beyond a standard
# Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the code.
#
# The minimal requirement is a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
# (as Swing is part of the standard library up to current versions).
#
# No external dependencies to list here.
