# This project is written in Java and relies solely on the standard Java Development Kit (JDK).
# Unlike Python projects which use requirements.txt, Java projects typically manage dependencies
# using build tools like Maven (pom.xml) or Gradle (build.gradle).
# This application does not have external third-party library dependencies beyond the JDK.
# To compile and run this application, you need a Java Development Kit (JDK),
# version 8 or higher is recommended.
