# This project is written in Java and primarily uses standard Java Development Kit (JDK) libraries.
# Java projects typically manage their dependencies using build automation tools like Maven (pom.xml)
# or Gradle (build.gradle) rather than a requirements.txt file.
#
# Based on the provided code, there are no explicit third-party libraries or external dependencies
# that would need to be listed in a Python-style requirements.txt format.
#
# To run this Java application, you will need:
# - A Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher (e.g., JDK 8, 11, 17, etc.).
# - An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions, or a command-line build tool like Maven or Gradle
#   to compile and run the .java files.
#
# Example (if there were external jars, they would be handled by Maven/Gradle, but for a conceptual `requirements.txt`):
# java-library-name:version  # This is a conceptual representation, not a standard Java dependency format.
