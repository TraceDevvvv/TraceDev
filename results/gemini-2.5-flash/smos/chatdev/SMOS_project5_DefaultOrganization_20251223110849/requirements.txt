# This Java project utilizes only standard libraries available in the Java Development Kit (JDK).
# Therefore, it does not have external third-party dependencies that would be listed in a
# 'requirements.txt' file, which is typically used for Python projects.
#
# To compile and run this application, a Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
# is required. It has been developed and tested with Java 8 (or higher) compatibility.
#
# No specific third-party JAR files or external package managers (like Maven or Gradle) are used
# for dependency management in this particular implementation, as all used classes are part of
# the standard Java API (e.g., javax.swing, java.awt, java.util).
