# This project is a pure Java Swing application.
# It uses only standard Java Development Kit (JDK) libraries and does not
# require any external third-party JAR dependencies.
#
# Dependencies for Java projects are typically managed with build tools like Maven (pom.xml)
# or Gradle (build.gradle). Since no external libraries are utilized, neither is strictly
# necessary for dependency management, but a build tool could be used for project setup.
#
# The primary runtime requirement is a Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
# A minimum version is specified below, similar to how Python packages list versions.
#
# java-runtime>=1.8
