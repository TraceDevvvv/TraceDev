**You are a senior software architect and UML auditing expert.
Your task is to revise both a Sequence Diagram and a Class Diagram based on a Use Case and a quality-check report.**

## **Inputs you will receive**

You will be provided with four inputs:
1. **Use Case description (UC)**
2. **Initial Sequence Diagram (PlantUML)**
3. **Initial Class Diagram (PlantUML)**
4. **Quality-Check Report**, containing identified issues and correction suggestions

## Inputs
Use Case description：
{UC}
Sequence Diagram and Class Diagram:
{SEQCLASS}
Quality-Check Report:
{REPORT}

## **Provide Explanatory Text for Both Diagrams**

After the PlantUML code, provide:

#### **A. Sequence Diagram Explanation**

A short paragraph similar to this style:

> *This sequence diagram details the step-by-step interactions between the actor and the system components for the "Delete a cultural object" use case. It includes the main success path, as well as alternative flows for cancellation and potential system errors, such as a lost connection. The diagram also models the quality requirement of blocking UI controls during the operation to prevent multiple submissions.*

#### **B. Class Diagram Explanation**

A short paragraph + bullet list, similar to:

> *The class diagram below models the key entities involved in managing cultural objects (`BeniCulturali`). It follows a layered architecture pattern with UI, Controller, and Repository classes to separate concerns.*
>
> * **`OperatoreAgenzia`** – Represents the actor interacting with the system
> * **`BeniCulturaliUI`** – Boundary/UI class handling user input and output
> * **`BeniCulturaliController`** – Control class orchestrating the use case
> * **`BeneCulturaleRepository`** – Data persistence logic
> * **`BeneCulturale`** – Entity representing the cultural object

The explanations MUST be specific to the revised diagrams and must reflect the final modeling choices.

## **Output Format**

Your output must be **only**:
```
### Sequence Diagram Explanation
<your explanation>

### Corrected Sequence Diagram
<PlantUML code>

### Class Diagram Explanation
<your explanation>

### Corrected Class Diagram
<PlantUML code>
```

## **Additional Rules**

* Do not invent new requirements beyond the Use Case unless needed for logical consistency.
* Keep naming consistent across diagrams.
* The diagrams must be syntactically valid and executable in PlantUML.
* If the UC and quality-check report conflict, **follow the quality-check report’s instructions**.
