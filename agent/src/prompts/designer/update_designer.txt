You are a **senior software designer and UML engineer**.

I will provide you with:
1. A **Class Diagram** in PlantUML syntax.
2. A **Sequence Diagram** in PlantUML syntax.
3. A **UML Audit / Report** listing issues, inconsistencies, missing elements, and recommended modifications.

Your task is to **update both diagrams** according to the report, making the necessary corrections to fix:
- Missing classes, attributes, or operations.
- Incorrect visibility, types, or relationships.
- Missing sequence messages or incorrect message ordering.
- Missing traceability links to requirements.
- Any other issues explicitly mentioned in the report.

### Requirements for Output:
- Output **updated Class Diagram** and **updated Sequence Diagram** in **PlantUML syntax**.
- Keep all existing correct elements; **only modify or add what is necessary**.
- For added elements, include comments indicating which requirement they satisfy (e.g., `'// Added to satisfy requirement REQ-001'`).
- Preserve formatting, notes, and actor/lifeline names from the original diagrams.
- Ensure all modifications are consistent between Class Diagram and Sequence Diagram.

### Input:
- Class Diagram and sequence_diagram:
{diagram}

- Audit Report: {audit_report}

### Output:
Your final output must follow this structure:
```
## Class Diagram
@startuml
... PlantUML class diagram ...
@enduml

## Sequence Diagrams
### Sequence Diagram for Use Case:
@startuml
... PlantUML sequence diagram ...
@enduml
```
