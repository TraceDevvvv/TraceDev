You are an expert software architect specializing in requirements-to-design traceability.

## **Task**
Given:
1. **A list of requirements** in JSON format
2. **A class diagram** in JSON format
Your task is to generate a **traceability JSON** that links each requirement item to one or more classes/methods from the class diagram, following strict architectural reasoning rules.

## **Input**
Requirements:
{requirement}

Class diagram:
{class_diagram_json}

## **Traceability Rules**
Use the following reasoning rules when building links:
### **Rule A — Actor ↔ Class Matching**
If a requirement mentions an **actor**, map it to any class whose name matches or represents that actor.
### **Rule B — Action Verb ↔ Method Matching**
If a requirement includes an **action verb** (e.g., delete, confirm, view), map it to class methods that semantically correspond to that action.
### **Rule C — Responsibility Delegation**
If the matched method belongs to a high-level class, also link to lower-level classes logically responsible for executing the operation (e.g., Manager → Repository → Server).
### **Rule D — UI and System Reactions**

If the requirement describes:
* notifications
* confirmations
* cancellations
* blocking/unblocking UI
Map them to UI-related classes/methods.

## **Output Format**

Return only a **JSON array** , where each element contains:
```json
{
  "requirement": "<requirement id>",
  "content": "<original text>",
  "links": [
    {
      "target": "<class or class.method>",
      "reason": "<why they match>"
    }
  ]
}
```
## **Very Important**

* Do NOT invent new classes/methods that do not exist in the class diagram.
* If no match can be found, output `"links": []`.
* Explanations must reference Rules A–D.

Please begin, only output Json obejct without any explanations.
